# Raman Surface Map Analysis Framework

A Python framework for automated analysis of Raman surface mapping data in condensed matter systems. Developed as a Senior Honours Project at the University of Edinburgh (School of Physics and Astronomy).

## Overview

Raman surface mapping produces large volumes of spectral data — hundreds to thousands of individual spectra — that are difficult to interpret manually. This framework provides four analytical tools to address this:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Spatial Visualiser** | Interactive heatmap for exploring spectral intensity distributions across a sample surface |
| **Distinct Spectra Estimation** | PCA and noise-whitened HFC methods to estimate the number of spectrally distinct sources |
| **Spectral Extraction** | Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to extract and spatially map distinct spectral components |
| **Compound Prediction** | 1D CNN (reconstructed from Liu et al., 2017) for Raman spectrum classification; achieves **90.7% test accuracy** on the RRUFF mineral database |

## Methods

### Preprocessing Pipeline

Applied prior to estimation and extraction:

- **Whitaker-Hayes despiking** — removes cosmic ray artefacts
- **Asymmetric least squares (ASLS) baseline correction** — removes fluorescence background
- **Min-max normalisation** — scales spectra to [0, 1] for NMF compatibility

### Distinct Spectra Estimation

Two methods are implemented and compared:

- **PCA (scree method)** — identifies the elbow in the eigenvalue spectrum; found to be the most reliable estimator for condensed matter Raman data
- **PCA (80% explained variance)** — tends to overestimate; sensitive to SNR and spectral range
- **Noise-whitened HFC (NWHFC)** — hyperspectral virtual dimensionality method; evaluated across false alarm rates from 10⁻² to 10⁻⁷. Found to be volatile and unreliable without sample-specific tuning for this data type

### NMF Extraction

- **Initialisation:** NNDSVDA (non-negative double SVD, average variant) for dense data
- **Solver:** Coordinate descent
- **Loss:** Frobenius norm (least-squares); note that Raman noise is Poisson-distributed, so KL-divergence loss may be more appropriate for future work
- **Max iterations:** 10,000

### CNN Architecture

Reconstructed from Liu et al., *Analyst*, 2017. A LeNet-variant 1D CNN:

- Three convolutional blocks (16 → 32 → 64 kernels, sizes 21 → 11 → 5), each followed by batch normalisation, Leaky ReLU, and max-pooling (stride 2)
- Fully connected layer (2048 neurons) with batch normalisation and dropout (0.5)
- Output layer with softmax over *C* classes
- Trained with class-weighted categorical cross-entropy and Adam optimiser
- Data augmentation: spectral shift, noise injection, and linear combination of same-class spectra (4.4× training set increase)

**Result:** 90.7% test accuracy on 493 test spectra across 533 classes (cf. 93.3% reported by Liu et al.). However, the model overfitted.
